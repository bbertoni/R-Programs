## Input Data
The input data accelerometer data from Samsung Galaxy S Smartphones is described here http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and was obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip on June 2, 2016.

This data contains many files and folders.  I used the data that they provided which they derived from the raw data and randomly divided into a "training" set and a "test" set.  In particular I made use of the files

* "UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt" - contains 561 derived variables describing training observations
* "UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt" - contains the subject number for each of the training observations
* "UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt" - contains the activity labels for each of the training observations
* "UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt" - contains the 561 derived variables describing the test observations
* "UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt" - contains the subject number for each of the test observations
* "UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt" - contains the activity labels for each of the test observations
* "UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt" - lists the names of the 561 variables
* "UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt" - relates the activity labels (numbers) to their actual names
